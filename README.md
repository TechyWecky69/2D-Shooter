# 2D-Shooter

This is day #2 of programming something of my viewer's choice every day. Today was a 2D shooter requested by "Ahh" Tech and The "TechT0ker". It's a simple 2d shooter where enemies appear on sides and you have to kill them and score points.

The date is Friday 29th November 2024


## PLAYING
When you want to play, download "build.bat" or "build.sh" depending on your operating system and it will install everything for you!
